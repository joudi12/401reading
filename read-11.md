# JupyterLab
___

- JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. For a demonstration of JupyterLab and its features, you can view this video:

- JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.

- You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters. Documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computing, for example:

- JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats. JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.) and can also display rich kernel output in these formats. See File and Output Formats for more information.

- JupyterLab extensions can customize or enhance any part of JupyterLab, including new themes, file editors, and custom components.

- JupyterLab is served from the same server and uses the same notebook document format as the classic Jupyter Notebook.

# NumPy
___

*NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like scikit-learn, that use NumPy under the hood. NumPy was originally developed in the mid 2000s, and arose from an even older package called Numeric. This longevity means that almost every data analysis or machine learning package for Python leverages NumPy in some way.*

#### Numpy 2-Dimensional Arrays

*With NumPy, we work with multidimensional arrays. We’ll dive into all of the possible types of multidimensional arrays later on, but for now, we’ll focus on 2-dimensional arrays. A 2-dimensional array is also known as a matrix, and is something you should be familiar with. In fact, it’s just a different way of thinking about a list of lists. A matrix has rows and columns. By specifying a row number and a column number, we’re able to extract an element from a matrix.*
- We can create a NumPy array using the numpy.array function. If we pass in a list of lists, it will automatically create a NumPy array with the same number of rows and columns. Because we want all of the elements in the array to be float elements for easy computation, we’ll leave off the header row, which contains strings. One of the limitations of NumPy is that all the elements in an array have to be of the same type, so if we include the header row, all the elements in the array will be read in as strings. Because we want to be able to do computations like find the average quality of the wines, we need the elements to all be floats.
- We now know how to create arrays, but unless we can retrieve results from them, there isn’t a lot we can do with NumPy. We can use array indexing to select individual elements, groups of elements, or entire rows and columns. One important thing to keep in mind is that just like Python lists, NumPy is zero-indexed, meaning that the index of the first row is 0, and the index of the first column is 0. If we want to work with the fourth row, we’d use index 3, if we want to work with the second row, we’d use index 1, and so on. We’ll again work with the wines array:

#### 1-Dimensional NumPy Arrays
- So far, we’ve worked with 2-dimensional arrays, such as wines. However, NumPy is a package for working with multidimensional arrays. One of the most common types of multidimensional arrays is the 1-dimensional array, or vector. As you may have noticed above, when we sliced wines, we retrieved a 1-dimensional array. A 1-dimensional array only needs a single index to retrieve an element. Each row and column in a 2-dimensional array is a 1-dimensional array. Just like a list of lists is analogous to a 2-dimensional array, a single list is analogous to a 1-dimensional array. If we slice wines and only retrieve the third row, we get a 1-dimensional array:

#### Converting Data Types

- You can use the numpy.ndarray.astype method to convert an array to a different type. The method will actually copy the array, and return a new array with the specified data type. For instance, we can convert wines to the int data type:
