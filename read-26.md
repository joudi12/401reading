# Django

## What is Django?
- Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It is free and open source, has a thriving and active community, great documentation, and many options for free and paid-for suppor

- Django follows the "Batteries included" philosophy and provides almost everything developers might want to do "out of the box". Because everything you need is part of the one "product", it all works seamlessly together, follows consistent design principles, and has extensive and up-to-date documentation.
- Django can be (and has been) used to build almost any type of website â€” from content management systems and wikis, through to social networks and news sites. It can work with any client-side framework, and can deliver content in almost any format (including HTML, RSS feeds, JSON, XML, etc). The site you are currently reading is built with Django!


> Sending the request to the right view (urls.py)


*A URL mapper is typically stored in a file named urls.py. In the example below, the mapper  (urlpatterns) defines a list of mappings between routes (specific URL patterns) and corresponding view functions. If an HTTP Request is received that has a URL matching a specified pattern then the associated view function will be called and passed the request.*

```

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('book/<int:id>/', views.book_detail, name='book_detail'),
    path('catalog/', include('catalog.urls')),
    re_path(r'^([0-9]+)/$', views.best),
]
```
- The urlpatterns object is a list of path() and/or re_path() functions (Python lists are defined using square brackets, where items are separated by commas and may have an optional trailing comma. For example: [item1, item2, item3,]).

- The first argument to both methods is a route (pattern) that will be matched. The path() method uses angle brackets to define parts of a URL that will be captured and passed through to the view function as named arguments. The re_path() function uses a flexible pattern matching approach known as a regular expression. We'll talk about these in a later article!

- The second argument is another function that will be called when the pattern is matched. The notation views.book_detail indicates that the function is called book_detail() and can be found in a module called views (i.e. inside a file named views.py)
