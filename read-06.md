## Random Module in Python
#### When to use it?
- We want the computer to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin etc. When making your password database more secure or powering a random page feature of your website.

##### Random functions

- The Random module contains some very useful functions.

##### Randit 
- If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.

###### Random 
- If you want a larger number, you can multiply it. For example, a random number between 0 and 100:

###### Shuffle
- The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

### Risk Analysis
- In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.

- There are certain risks that are unavoidable. I am enumerating them below:

- The time that you allocated for testing

- A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application

- Urgency from the clients to deliver the project

- Incomplete requirements
*In such cases, you have to tackle the situation with care. Following points can be taken care of:*
- Conduct Risk Assessment review meeting

- Use maximum resources to work on high-risk areas

- Create a Risk Assessment database for future use

- Identify and notice the risk magnitude indicators: high, medium, low.

### Risk Identification

*There are different sets of risks included in the risk identification process. Those are as follows:*

- Business Risks: This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic. It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project

- Testing Risks: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.

- Premature Release Risk: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required

- Software Risks: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process.
