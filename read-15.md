# Machine Learning Intro

- First, we must clear up one of the biggest misconceptions about machine learning:

- Machine learning is not about algorithms.

- When you open a textbook or a university syllabus, you'll often be greeted by a grocery list of algorithms.

- This has fueled the misconception that machine learning is about mastering dozens of algorithms. However, it's much more than that...

- Machine learning is a comprehensive approach to solving problems...

- ...and individual algorithms are only one piece of the puzzle. The rest of the puzzle is how you apply them the right way.
## What makes machine learning so special?

- Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.

- For true machine learning, the computer must be able to learn patterns that it's not explicitly programmed to identify.

- Example: the curious child
- A young child is playing at home... And he sees a candle! He cautiously waddles over.

    Out of curiosity, he sticks his hand over the candle flame.
    "Ouch!," he yells, as he yanks his hand back.
    "Hmm... that red and bright thing really hurts!"
    Ooh a candle!
    Ooh a candle!

    Two days later, he's playing in the kitchen... And he sees a stove-top! Again, he cautiously waddles over.

    He's curious again, and he's thinking about sticking his hand over it.
    Suddenly, he notices that it's red and bright!
    "Ahh..." he thinks to himself, "not today!"
    He remembers that red and bright means pain, and he ignores the stove top.

    Model - a set of patterns learned from data.
    Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.
    Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.
    Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.
    Features - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.
    Target variable - A specific variable you're trying to predict.
    Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.
